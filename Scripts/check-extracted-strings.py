"""Diff each string catalogue against the keys Xcode's extractor actually found.

A key missing from a catalogue is not a build failure and never warns: the
runtime renders the English key itself on a Chinese device, silently. So it has
to be checked, and checked against the compiler rather than a grep — a grep
cannot see SwiftUI's bare `Text("Grid")` and cannot see an interpolated key,
which is looked up as `%lld selected` rather than as anything you typed.

A release build emits one `.stringsdata` per source file, whose
`tables.Localizable` is the exact set of keys the runtime will look up.

Two traps this script exists to avoid:

*   `GeneratedStringSymbols_Localizable.stringsdata` is generated *from the
    catalogue*, not from source. Counting it makes the comparison circular and
    reports a perfect match no matter how many keys are unextractable. It is
    excluded here, deliberately.
*   Xcode's extractor only walks one target. A `String(localized:)` in a
    package target never reaches the app's `.stringsdata`, so each target that
    shows the user a sentence owns its own catalogue and is diffed separately.

Usage: check-extracted-strings.py [--keys <out.json>] <derived-data-path> [configuration-platform]

`--keys` writes the extracted key set instead of checking it: the input
`apply-translations.py` builds the catalogue from.

Fila's script, with its module catalogues taken out — XrashKit shows the user
no sentence of its own, so the app's catalogue is the only one.
