# Ad-hoc sign every library embedded in Xrash.app/Frameworks.
#
# An unsigned Xcode build leaves two kinds of library there: the linked
# frameworks, which the linker already ad-hoc signed, and the Swift
# compatibility dylibs the toolchain copies in for OS versions older than the
# SDK (`libswiftCompatibilitySpan.dylib` on iOS 18), which still carry Apple's
# own signature. A custom firmware iOS 18 refuses that signature at a path outside
# the system ("code signature invalid", errno 1) and dyld halts the app at
# launch — while iOS 26 never loads the library, so the crash shows only on
# the older device. Signing all of them the way the app itself is signed puts
# every library on one footing, and the read-back below fails the build if
# one did not take.
